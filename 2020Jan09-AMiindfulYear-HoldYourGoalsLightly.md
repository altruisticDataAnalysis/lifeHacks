## Hold Your Goals Lightly

#### 2020 January 9

"When an archer is shooting for nothing, he has all his skill.  
If he shoots for a brass buckle, he is already nervous.  
If he shoots for a prize of gold, he goes blind or sees two targets--  
...  
His skill has not changed. But the prize divides him.  
He cares. He thinks more of winning than of shooting--  
And the need to win drains him of power."

--Chuang Tzu

## Goals

Hold your goals a little more lightly.

A focus on end points can divert our attention from the process, which makes reaching our desired destination more challenging.

On a long distance run, don't cloud your mind with negative thoughts. The possibility of winning should not overshadow one's mind. This detracts from a pure zen experience.

Try. Simply try your best. That is the goal and all you can do.
