Small vs. large intestine for sample?

# Microbiome

## Gut buddies (microbiome)

Akkermansia muciniphila (Bacteria) live on mucous.
Gut buddies like oligosacharides, inulin (Sweet Leaf- Stevia, Plant Paradox, pg 309)
Iodized sea salt for a healthy thyroid.
Sorghum and millet are grains without hulls, thus no lectins.
Swerve is a good sweetener for baking.
Just Like Sugar contains polysacharide inulin, 
which gut bugs love but cannot metabolize.
Nutritional yeast, nori, marine collagen (Amazon0 Vital Proteins), 
Hemp Tofu at Whole Foods, Living Havest Tempt Hemp Tofu (hefu), non-GMO. 
Hemp protein powder is high in heart healthy omega-3, all essemtial amino acids.

## Gut gangsters



# Proteins

## Lectins (e.g. gluten) is a plant poison.

### Gluten


# Genes

## IGF- Insulin-like Growth Factor

IGF is stimulated by whey protein.
Used by body builders to build muscle.
IGF stimulates cancer and ages people (Plant Paradox pg.310).


# Pesticides

## Glyphosate (Round-Up)

Glyphosate is an herbicide and crop desiccant. 
The phosphonate (organophosphorus compound) inhibits 
the plant enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase.
Glyphosate blocks Shikimate pathway in plants.
Glyphosate is an antibiotic, it kills bacteria.
Glyphosate used as desiccant in conventional farming
for oats, wheat, soy beans, corn, canola as a harvesting aid.
Not listed as ingredients.
Fed to farm animals.
Kills microbiome.
Causes leaky gut.
Cause of all diseases.
GMOs have introduced lectin to paralyze insects.
Snowdrop lectin introduced into tomatoes, corn.
No labels for GMO in US.
Glyphosates present in 95% in humans via urine.
90% of mothers milk test positive.
Bayer (EU) owns Monsanto.
EU approved Round-Up.


# Hormones

## Serotonin (SLC6A4, aliases 5-HTT, SERT: chr17:30194319-30236002)

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) is a monoamine neurotransmitter. 
Serotonin is primarily found in the enteric nervous system 
located in the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). 

## Melatonin

Melatonin is a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles.
It is primarily released by the pineal gland, 
endocrine gland near center of brain.

### Regulation of the Pineal Gland

The pineal gland may influence secretion of sex hormones, 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). (Motta 1967)

## Follicle-stimulating Hormone

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a gonadotropin, 
a glycoprotein polypeptide hormone. FSH is synthesized and 
secreted by the gonadotropic cells of the anterior pituitary gland, 
and regulates the development, growth, pubertal maturation, and 
reproductive processes of the body. FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) 
work together in the reproductive system.

Lab test- blood.

## Luteinizing Hormone (LH)

## Testosterone

## Estrogen



# Fasting

Culls bad bacteria.
Water fast is similar to a vegan diet in outcome.

# Mucous

Mucopolysacharides


# Brain

## Glymphatic system

Glymphatic system cleanses central nervous system (CNS), e.g. a brain wash. 
![Schematic of glymphatic flow](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Video_schematic_of_glymphatic_flow.ogv).
Eat like a king for breakfast.
Eat like a queen for lunch.
Eat like a pouper for dinner.
Don't eat before bed time.
Skip a dinner once per week.
Late day intermittent fasting.
10 times more active paravascular waste clearance at night.
Eat seasonally.
