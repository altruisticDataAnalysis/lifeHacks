"My expectations were reduced to zero when I was twenty-one. Everything since then has been a bonus."

--Stephen Hawking

In 1997, I lost control of my bike on loose gravel and slid in between the front and back wheel of a turning truck. I looked up at the undercarriage. Uncertain whether I should try to move mybody in between the back wheels or not, time slowed. The rear tire rolled over my bike shredding the metal. I engaged my stomach muscles and the rear tire ran over my pony tail. The woman screaming from the sidewalk gave me confirmation that my life was on the line. That was the beginning of my bonus time.
