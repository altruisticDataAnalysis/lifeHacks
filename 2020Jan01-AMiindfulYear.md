"Begin doing what you want to do now. We are not living in eternity. We have only this moment, sparkling like a star in our hand and melting like a snowflake."

-- Marie Beynon Ray

## Modeh ani

Hebrew:

מוֹדֶה אֲנִי לְפָנֶֽיךָ מֶֽלֶךְ חַי וְקַיָּים. שֶׁהֶֽחֱזַֽרְתָּ בִּי נִשְׁמָתִי ,בְּחֶמְלָה. רַבָּה אֱמֽוּנָתֶֽךָ׃

English:

I give thanks before you, King living and eternal, for You have returned within me my soul with compassion; abundant is Your faithfulness!


## Gratitude

**I am grateful for my wife Daniele, stepson David, 3 stepdaughters Natalie (Ketzel) Jojo and Claire (Mouche), father-in-law Stuart, and mother-in-law Yvonne (Vivian). They have made my life immeasurably more vibrant and joyful.**

I am grateful for our the beautiful homes in San Francisco and Tahoe.


## Forward Looking

I will nurture collaborations and find new ways to help patients with diverse diseases.

I will do what I can at every moment.
