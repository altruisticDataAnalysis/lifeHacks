## Arthritis

the darkness has not overcome it."

--John 1:5

Dr. Jeffrey Mann gave me an analysis of my ankle, foot MRI last week. My goal was to confirm or eliminate the presence of a stress fracture from The Big Sur Marathon last September. A stress fracture would have meant 6 weeks of no trail running, as further damage can mean permanent disability. The news was that I had a piece of my ankle bone which had broken off. He said he could remove it if it caused me enough pain. It doesn't really cause much pain. There seems to be no stress fractures. That is the good news. So nothing is keeping me from running as much as I want. Well, almost nothing. It seems there are signs of arthritis. I feel like I've been living with arthritis all my life, but it was nice to have a doctor look objectively at my bones and call it out.

After my doctors appointment then went for a 10 mile run to the beach. That was a bit excessive, but it had been so long since I had done this favorite run of mine, [Buena Vista Park to Ocean Beach](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8bYSO9pqPF/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).

The bursitis in my shoulder is flaring after 2 years of peace. Looking for something to help, I am going to try Naked Creatine and an organic vegan calcium supplement with vitamen D.

Shine on.
