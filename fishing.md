## Fishing Knots

If the fishing line were a replicating bit of DNA, 
the leading is copied 5' to 3' continuously.
The lagging strand is copied in Okazaki fragments as the helicase unzips.

### Dropper Loop  Knot

Make a loop and wrap it around the leading and lagging strands 6 times.
Pass loop through central hole. Hold loop and stretch leading and lagging strands.
