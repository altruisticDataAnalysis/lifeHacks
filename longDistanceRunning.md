## The Left-Side-Of-The-Road Rule

It’s the law in California to run on the left side of the road, unless you’re on the sidewalk. 

I just started doing this last week, so it's great to read Rule 13 from the above link supports this new style. 
I'm switching from a exclusive life of trail running to a hybrid with road running. 
It's great for linking up parks across San Francisco... e.g. Golden Gate, to Lands End to Presidio.
