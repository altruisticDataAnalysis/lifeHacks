## Catastrophizing

#### 2020 January 7

"I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened."

--Mark Twain

The brain tries to seek certainty in the future. 
Certainty is equated to evolutionary survival.
Predicting future events bestows a selective advantage.

Some of the minds thinking styles include 
* worries about failing, 
* concerns about job security and financial ruin, 
* fears of ill health.

**Catastophize**- to view or talk about (an event or situation) as worse than it actually is, or as if it were a catastrophe.

Stop catastrophizing and get on with your life!
