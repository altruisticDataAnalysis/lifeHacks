To err is human,  
to forgive is divine.
--Alexander Pope

Don't be so hard on yourself when you make mistakes. This should not lead to self criticism, nor reclusion from participation. Reframe failure as growth and learning.

"a person who never made a mistake never tried anything new."  
--Albert Einstein

When ten thousand storage batteries experiments failed for Thomas Edison, he remarked, "I have not failed. I have just found ten thousand ways that don't work."

"Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently."
--Henry Ford
