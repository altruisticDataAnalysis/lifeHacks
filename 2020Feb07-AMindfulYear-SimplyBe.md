## Simply Be

#### 2020 February 07

"To wait is often harder than to work."

--Peter Marshall

View downtime as a chance to reconnect.  
Waiting or doing nothing is an ability being lost by people.  
Often switching attention, we fill all "empty" time.  

Simply be, when the opportunity arises.  
Take the world in.  
Observe and enjoy what you notice.
