--Lama Thubten Yeshe

### Epictetus

The philosopher Epictetus wrote in Enchiridion, "It is in our power to discover the will of nature from those matters on which we have no differenece of opinion. For example, when another man's slave has broken the wine cup, we are very ready to say at once, 'Such things must happen.' Know then that when your own cup is broken, you ought to behave in the same way as when your neighbor's was broken. Apply the same principle to higher matters. Is another's child or wife dead? Not one of us but would say, 'Such is the lot of man'; but when one's own dies, straightaway one cries, 'Alas! miserable am I.' But we ought to remember what our feelings are when we hear it of another."
