## Free Hugs 

#### 2020 February 05

"Hug Machine is always open for business."

--Scott Campbell

Hugs are good.  
Hugs are free.  
You want one.  
And so do I.  

Hugs:  
reduce stress hormones,  
slow heart rates,  
lower blood pressure,  
release oxytocin,  
improve immune function,  
increase pain tolerance. 

If you are alone,  
cross your arms over your chest and give yourself a hug.  
Focus on your breath.  
Love yourself.  
Experience comfort and compassion.  

Give someone a hug today.
