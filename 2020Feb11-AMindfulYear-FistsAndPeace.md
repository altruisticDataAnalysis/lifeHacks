## Fists Are War

## Open Hands Are Peace

#### 2020 February 11

"Our moods do not believe in each other."

--Ralph Waldo Emerson

"The fist, too, was once an open hand with fingers."

--Yehuda Amichai (Israeli poet)

"You can't shake hands with a closed fist."

--Mohatma Gandhi

War and peace within ourselves is reflected outside of us. We all want peace, yet the strength to fight can be a group decision.
