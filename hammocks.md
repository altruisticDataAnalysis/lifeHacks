By weight Hummingbird Hammocks seem to beat DutchMade Hammocks.

[Dyneema Tarps](https://www.hammockgear.com/dyneema-fiber-standard-tarp-with-doors/) cost more, and 
weigh less than [sil-poly tarps](https://hummingbirdhammocks.com/shop/pelican-rain-tarp/). 
Since it doesn't rain when one packs a rainfly, the lighter one is the choice.
