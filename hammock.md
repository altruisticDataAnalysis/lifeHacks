## Hammock Ideas

### Peak Bag

Stuff sack can be attached to hammock peak for storage of down slippers, headlamp, etc.

### Zipper pulls

Add bright zing-it line to zippers for easy pulls on warbler, 


## Suspenseion

### Tree Straps x 2

Wrap flat and tie with rubber bands.


## Marlinspike Hitch Toggle

Marlinspike hitch is tied by looping tree strap, displace loop across leading strand. 
Pull leading strand through loop, insert toggle, tighten. Hang whoopie sling on knot, 
not toggle.


### Figure-8 lashing for whoopie sling

It may also be useful to have an extra set of tree straps for boulder anchoring or big trees.


### Drip line

Thick string tightly doubled around whoopie sling under tarp hang.

Engineer a drip line from the low corner of a tarp to a water bottle attached
with a "jug sling" knot, pg160 of "The Ultimate Hang 2", for collecting water.


### Self-Tensioning Guyline

Tie 12 inches of 1/8 or 3/32 shock cord into continuous loop through the tarp pullout. 
Use a Fisherman's knot for the continuous loop.
Then attached to guyline to the shock cord with a single or double Becket's hitch.


### Jug Sling

Wrap the guyline in a figure-8 pattern across palm using thumb and pinky.
Finish the final 1' by wrapping around the figure-8 loop and ending with a slippery hitch.


### Boots and Pack

Hang boots and backpack at edges of hammock with mitten hooks or carabiners


### Gear Hammock

Use a small round stone as a gathering on the top of the backpack cover to attach some Zing-it. 
Lash more Zing-it to the bottom of the cover for a gear hammock below the hammock.


### Calf Ridge

* tie variable length gathered end whipping to account for ridge 
* a sit pad under ankles
* hang feet 12-18" higher than head
