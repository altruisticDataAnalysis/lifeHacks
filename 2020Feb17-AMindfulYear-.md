Lay your hand over your heart and feel.  
Feel my light inside of you.  
You hold my light and make it live.  
You are living sunlight.  

--Molly Bang and Penny Chrisholm

### Meditation from Thich Nhat Hanh

* Breathing in, I am aware of my heart.
* Breathing out, I smile to my heart.
* I vow to eat, drink, and work in ways that preserve my health and well-being.
