## No Score-Keeping

### 2020 January 4

"I cut ties with past conflicts, and make my personal life a clean, shiny slate. Beginning this moment, everything is new. When an old grievance repeats itself in my head, I introduce it to my new head-tenants: Tolerance and Equanimity. Then I give it its stupid T-dhirts and records back and tell it to leave."
