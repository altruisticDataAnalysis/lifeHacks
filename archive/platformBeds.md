1. [Platform bed for a queen mattress](https://www.instructables.com/id/Cheap-easy-low-waste-platform-bed/)

* 1x6s have been milled to 55" for slats,
* 2x4s have been milled to 4' and 5'11" as frame,
* 10" or 11" leg bits have been cut and sanded as well.

Get #10 wood screws: 2" [144], and 3" [16] 

Last steps to put it all together. 

* Predrill 2x4s for 3" screws at 3/4" interior to board
* Bracket long boards with shorter 4' boards (i.e. short boards on top of long boards)
* Check for square  with diagonal measurements
* Use cross beam to maintain square

The 2"x4" frame is 48"x71".

A queen mattress is 60"x80".

The final array of slats will be 55"x76".

The spacing of the 1"x6" (0.75"x5.5") is:

Wood | Marking | Spacing | Marking | Wood

<-- | 17.5" | 1.5" | 19" | --> 
<-- | 24.5" | 1.5" | 26" | --> 
<-- | 31.5" | 1.5" | 33" | -->
