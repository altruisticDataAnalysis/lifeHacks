## Aristotelian Ethics

#### 2020 January 4

"The more directly one aims to maximize pleasure and avoid pain, the more likely one is to produce instead a life bereft of depth, meaning, and community.

--Richard M. Ryan, Veronika Huta, and Edward L. Deci


### Associations

Bereft- deprived of or lacking something, especially a nonmaterial asset.

Hedonism- the goal of life is pleasure, the more, the better.

Aristotle wrote in *Nicomachean Ethics* that pleasure is the companion of ethical goodness for the *Phronimos* (wise person).

**Eudaimonia**, a Greek word for happiness, what we value most.

In theory, anything worthwhile involves some discomfort to attain.


### Invitation

Look for opportunities to choose living well over immediate pleasure.
