## Om Mani Padme Hum (The Jewel in the Lotus of the Heart)

"Real fearlessness is the product of tenderness. It comes from letting the world tickle your heart, your raw and beautiful heart. You are willing to open up, without resistance or shyness, and face the world. You are willing to share your heart with others."

-- Chogyam Trungpa

The quote above reminds me of the Chenrezi mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum.  
Translates as, the jewel in the lotus of the heart.  
The meaning is that there is something good in the heart of every person.

We become stronger, more compassionate people by reflecting on this mantra in meditation.
