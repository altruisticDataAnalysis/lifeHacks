## THE MATH

A couple of **raw cacao salted energy balls** to start off 
the morning will allow an early jump on the trail. 

Stealth is camping, eating and sleeping- off trail, 
out of sight of other wilderness travelers.

number of people = 1

number of days = 3

1.4 Pounds Per Person Per Day (PPPPD) = 22.4 oz of food per day = 2,800 calories (where 1oz = 125 calories)

- weight of MEALS per person per day = 10oz

22.4oz of food per day - MEALS = 12.4oz SNACKS PPPD


## MEALS

Meals are made up of breakfasts and dinners. 
Lunches are a grazing of snacks on the trail, not cooked. 

A stealth breakfast can be cooked off trail after 
the sun has risen and a beautiful spot has been found.
