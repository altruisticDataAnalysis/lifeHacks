## MEALS

Meals are made up of breakfasts and dinners. 
Lunches are a grazing of snacks on the trail, not cooked. 

A couple of chocolate salted energy balls to start off 
the morning will allow an early start on the trail. 

A stealth breakfast can be cooked off trail after 
the sun has risen and a beautiful spot has been found. 

Stealth is camping, eating and sleeping- off trail, 
out of sight of other wilderness travelers.
