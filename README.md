## Ultralight Backpacking, 

Combining alpine fly fishing, and minimalist hammock sheltering should be a fun pursuit this spring. 

Destinations will include Emmigrant Wilderness, Desolation Wilderness and Stanislaus Wilderness.

Need to update some gear and perhaps visit Lost Coast Outfitters, 540 Jackson St, San Francisco, CA 94133.

## Long Distance Urban Trail Barefoot Running

Goals are to increase mileage, decrease time, and move from minimalist footwear to barefoot running.

Plan to grab fresh oven roasted turkey, bagels at Falletti's after some serious miles.
