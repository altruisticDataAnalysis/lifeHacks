# Life Hacks

Tracking New Year Resolutions

## Ultralight Backpacking, 

Combining alpine fly fishing, and minimalist hammock sheltering should be a fun pursuit this spring. 
Destinations will include Emmigrant Wilderness, Desolation Wilderness and Stanislaus Wilderness.

## Long Distance Urban Trail Barefoot Running

Goals are to increase mileage, decrease time, and move from minimalist footwear to barefoot running.

Plan to grab fresh oven roasted turkey, bagels at Falletti's after some serious miles.
