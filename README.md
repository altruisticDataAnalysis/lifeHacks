 "The Classic Workbench requires about 80 board feet of 8/4 lumber and about 8
board feet of 4/4 for the shelf. These numbers reflect the actual volume of wood in the
bench, they don’t account for waste. There are some general rules for accounting for
waste, but we don’t like to use them because there are too many variables to be
accurate. You can get everything you need from 8’ boards, which are quite common. 10’
boards will also be useful, as you can get top boards and leg boards from their 120”
length. The main variable at the lumber yard will be board width. Width is important to
get the best yield. Make yourself a rough cutlist from the plans and take it with you to
the lumberyard. Note the width of the legs and the thickness of the top. For example,
the top is 3” thick. That means you’re going to want to find boards around 3-1/2”-4”
wide, or at least 7” wide so you can rip without a lot of waste and still have material for
jointing and planing to final thickness. Wide boards are cool, but you want best yield
here. If your lumber yard has shorts, you can usually save a bit of money by buying
these and using the stock for the legs and short rails. On the other hand, you can simply
spend a few extra bucks and order 150bf of lumber, straight-lined and skip planed and
use the leftovers for other projects. We’re frugally minded folks here, so we like to be
efficient as possible."

Contemplating making a [DIY wood burning stove like Shug Emergy](https://youtu.be/gSAXdYlfyqE). The [pocket bellows](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00LDSW5BA/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_GGlCCbEQQFRE0) is the game changer. I'm definitely in.

However, along the way I found a stove that is 1/3 the weight of my Ti alcohol stove. Yeah, I'm looking at you [Zelph's Fancee Feest](http://www.woodgaz-stove.com/fancee-feest.php) at 0.8oz or 24g.
