## Be Here Now

### 2020 January 2

**"You are always standing in the middle of sacred space, standing in the middle of the circle... Whatever comes into the space is there to teach you."** 

--Pema Chodron


Rest in the now. There is no other place you can be. This is the moment. It is everything.
