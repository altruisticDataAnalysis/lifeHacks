## Observing Resolutions

#### 2020 January 05

"Mindfulness gives you time. Time gives you choices. Choices, skillfully made, lead to freedom. You don't have to be swept away by your feeling. You can respond with wisdom and kindness rather than habit and reactivity." 

--Henepola Gunaratana


### New Year Resolutions

Try *not* thinking about a white bear. The harder one tries the stronger it becomes.

Mindfulness is watching thoughts or feelings come and go, using skillful observation.
