## If you love something

#### 2020 January 10

"Love is found in the things we've given up  
More than in the things that we have kept.

--Rich Mullins

Love is shown in the sharing of bread with another.  
Love yourself by letting go of the internal voice that berates the self for not being enough.  
Love is commitment, leaving a lascivious thought pattern behind. 

If you love something set it free.  
If it comes back itâ€™s yours.  
If not, it was never meant to be.
