## Listening

#### 2020 January 29

"The first duty of love is to listen."

-- Paul Tillich


Recognize the people in front of you. 

Realize the loveliness of people.

Ask someone a question as a porthole into their mind and heart.

  * What was your happiest moment of your life?  
  * What was the saddest moment of your life?
  * What have you learned about yourself?
  * What have you learned about the world?
  * What is your best memory of childhood?
  * What is your worst memory of childhood?

Hear them.
