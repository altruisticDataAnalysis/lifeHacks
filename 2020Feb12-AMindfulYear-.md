"Life is not a problem to be solved,  
but a reality to be experienced."

--Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan

Lucy, the puppy has been hiking well in Tahoe. I remember myself as a child. When I was walking with my parent, I remember taking two steps for every one of theirs. It was exhausting, to keep up. I'm being patient with my pup and letting her take in the world. Even when it takes an hour to go 1 mile in sub-zero temps. At other portions of the trail she runs at perfect pace with Maggie and me.
