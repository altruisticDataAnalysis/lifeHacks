## Miracles

#### 2020 February 02

"There are only two ways to live your life.  
One is as though nothing is a miracle.  
The is as though everything is a miracle."  

--Attributed to Albert Einstein

Think about the time it took the planet to form.  
Oxygen to become available.  
Life to evolve from the primordial soup.  
Your genes to be assembled and pass down countless generations.  
For you to be here, now.  
Seems somewhat improbable.
