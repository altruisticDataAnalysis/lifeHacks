"Technology can be our best friend, and  
technology can also be the biggest party pooper of our lives." 

--Steven Spielberg

Ubiquitous connection is a gift.  
It enables me to work remotely.  

We can control our experience of the digital world.  
We can wait to be informed about the news later in the day,  
instead of getting the unsettling dose first thing in the morning.  

I am turning off the Google News Routine that follows my morning alarm.
