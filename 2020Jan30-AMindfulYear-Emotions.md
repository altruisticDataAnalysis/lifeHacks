## Emotions

#### 2020 January 30

"I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions."

--Oscar Wilde

The sky is not affected by the elements. 
Clouds may obscure it, but the sky is untouched.

Be patient with children, and puppies.  
Our moods can be like the weather.  
Recognize them as such and realize your true nature.  

My dog had cancer, Hemangiosarcoma and needed to be euthanized last Sunday. He was a beautiful labrador. He was a terrible animal. He was the sweetest dog. He had a painful bleed, which let us know that it was his time to go. The week was so hard on my wife. She had Ricky for nine years. 

Yesterday we found a 3 month old labrador puppy at Marin Humane. Lily, Elle or Lucy (still tossing around names) is such a joy and gift. I wish myself patience. She is going to be a project the volunteer said yesterday. Ideed, a project of love, training and compassion.
