"When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive-- to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love."  
--Marcus Aurelius

"The Lord's mercies are not consumed, surely His compassions do not fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness."  --Lamentations 3:22-23

From this Lamentations quote, the Shulchan Aruch (Code of Jewish Law written by Joseph Karo in 1563) puts forth that every morning, God renew every person as a new creation.
