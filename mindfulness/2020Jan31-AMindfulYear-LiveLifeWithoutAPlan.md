## Live Life Without a Plan

#### 2020 January 31

"We must be willing to let go of the life we've planned,  
so as to have the life that is waiting for us."

--Joseph Campbell

Do expectations bind our experiences?  
Expectations are attachments.  
Attachments cause pain and suffering.  
Remember your breath.  
It follows a natural rhythm.  
So does your life.

Expectations are guides, not edicts.  
Hold them lightly.  
Letting go is being mindful of the flow of life.  
Focus on your breath.
