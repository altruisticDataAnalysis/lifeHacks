## Grounding

#### 2020 February 01

"Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads."

--Henry David Thoreau

The future is always uncertain.  
That is not just a Magic Eight Ball saying.  

To get connected walk barefoot on the earth.  
Run barefoot.   
Your feet will get tougher with time.  

Mentally visualize your breath moving into the air, atmosphere between the ground and the sky.
