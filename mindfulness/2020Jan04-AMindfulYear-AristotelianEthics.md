## Aristotelian Ethics

#### 2020 January 4

"The more directly one aims to maximize pleasure and avoid pain, the more likely one is to produce instead a life bereft of depth, meaning, and community.

--Richard M. Ryan, Veronika Huta, and Edward L. Deci


### Definitions

Bereft- deprived of or lacking something, especially a nonmaterial asset.

Hedonism- the goal of life is pleasure, the more, the better.

Eudaimonia- a Greek word for happiness, what we value most.


### Theory 

In theory, anything worthwhile involves some discomfort to attain. In other words, a eudaimonic way of life is found by giving up comfort, and lost by seeking comfort.

Aristotle wrote in *Nicomachean Ethics* that pleasure is the companion of ethical goodness for the *Phronimos* (wise person).


### Invitation

Look for opportunities to choose living well over immediate pleasure.
