## Be happy in your own skin

#### 2020 January 19

"Don't compare your version of success with anyone else's. Everyone has their own unique path. There will almost always be someone richer, fitter, happier, or more successful than you. The real challenge is to learn to appreciate what you have while you pursue all that you want."

--Ruben Chavez
