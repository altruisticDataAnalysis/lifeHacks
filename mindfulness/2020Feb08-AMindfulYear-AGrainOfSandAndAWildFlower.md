## A Grain of Sand and A Wild Flower

#### 2020 February 08

"To see a World in a Grain of Sand  
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower"

--Wiliam Blake

"Let us come alive to the splendor that is all around us  
and see the beauty in ordinary things."

--Thomas Merton

Experience the idiom of putting on rose colored glasses.  
Since the 1800s, this idea has been passed from person to person.  
Step out of you everyday perception and actually see what is around you.  
Not necessarily everything at once, perhaps just a single wildflower.  
Or realize that you are one of 7,763,344,287 people.  
For scale imagine you are one grain of sand at the beach called Earth's population.

"We've now estimated that there are about 8,000,000,000 = 8x10^9 grains of sand per cubic meter of beach."

--Jason Marshall, author of "The Math Dude's Quick and Dirty Guide to Algebra"
