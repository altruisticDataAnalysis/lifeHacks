## Seeds In Bloom

#### 2020 January 18

"You are always complete and in the process of becoming  
--a seed in full bloom."

--Rebecca Louick

### An Acorn

An acorn, in the right environment, will grow into a seedling, sapling and then a tall oak tree.

When you see a baby, you accept them as they are. The same goes for toddlers, teenagers, and adults.

We grow because we are whole, not to become whole.

I am whole,  
I am growing
