## Peace

#### 2020 February 03

"There is no peace of the sort you imagine.  
Oh, there is peace of course,  
but not anything that lives within us  
constantly and never leaves us.  
There is only the peace that  
must be won again and again,  
each new day of our lives."

--Herman Hesse

Have you experienced an emotional yoga session?  
One after which you felt unalloyed gratitude?  
Then gone on with your day and experienced supreme frustration?  
Why do we need to relearn mindfulness?  
Remember that feeling now.  
Experience it *de novo*.
