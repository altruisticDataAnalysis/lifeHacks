## One Heart

#### 2020 January 12

"There is no more appropriate prayer which a man can offer than that his heart may have a unity of purpose, and that nothing may be allowed to interfere with that one supreme purpose."

--Albert Barnes

Focus is a simple singularity of purpose.

A unity of purpose can also be attained by removing distractions.


## Invitation

What unites your passions?

What competes for your attention?

Can you unify your heart's purpose?
