## If you love something

#### 2020 January 10

"Love is found in the things we've given up  
More than in the things that we have kept.

--Rich Mullins

Love is shown in the sharing of bread with another.  
Love yourself by letting go of the internal voice that berates the self for not being enough.  
Love is commitment, leaving a lascivious thought pattern behind. 

If you love something set it free.  
If it comes back itâ€™s yours.  
If not, it was never meant to be.

### Invitation

Considering how love has been expresed in my life through the things I've given up-- and what I've gained in return.

I have given up lactose, alcohol and tobacco. I enjoyed all three of these items in my life. My body however, has decided that it distinctly does not enjoy any of them. I've let them go. 

What I've found in exchange is a wonderful wife and family. Admittedly, only tobacco would have been a show stopper for Dani. But she's very happy to have her cheese, all to herself!
