## Find Yourself

#### 2020 January 13

"To find yourself, lose yourself in the service of others."

--Mahatma Gandhi

## Service

What is the focus in Gandhi's quote? 
* Finding yourself? 
* Losing yourself? 
* Service to others?

The goal is to find yourself. The recommendation is to commit fully to the service of others. This is the action and reaction which Gandhi is proposing.

## Invitation

Help others. Hold the door for someone. Yield to a car with a signal. Share what you have in abundance. Share what you can in sparsity.
