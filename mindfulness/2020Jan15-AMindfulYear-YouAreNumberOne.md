## You Are Number One

"The most important relationship in your life is the relationship that you have with yourself. Who else is with you at all times?

--Diane Von Furstenberg


Self-criticism is a human state.  
How do we keep this primal trait working for us in positive ways?  
Become **aware** of the inner voice. Then **acknowledge** it is trying to help.  
Translate the concern into an uplifting and inspiring motivation.


### Invitation

When your inner critic speaks, acknowledge that it is trying to help. Then ask yourself, 

**What would I want a good friend to say to me?**
