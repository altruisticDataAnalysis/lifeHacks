## Carpe Momentum

#### 2020 January 20

"Embrace relational uncertainty. It's called romance.  
Embrace spiritual uncertainty. It's called mystery.  
Embrace occupational uncertainty. It's called destiny.
Embrace emotional uncertainty. It's called joy.  
Embrace intellectual uncertainty. It's called revelation."
--Mark Batterson

Life is uncertainty. Carpe Diem. More than that, Carpe Momentum.
